# Cake-Application
I developed the interactive web application "Bake A Cake" with the Angular framework to give cake enthusiasts a convenient platform. The application's seamless admin panel and user interface make it possible to manage cakes and orders effectively.

I designed a dynamic admin dashboard with Angular that allows administrators to easily add, modify, & remove cake listings. This feature is made possible using Angular services and JSON data, which guarantee a smooth user experience & effective data processing. Furthermore, customers can quickly traverse the platform, view various cakes & make payments.

The Bake A Cake demonstrates the ability of Angular in developing a dynamic platform for cake enthusiasts by combining JSON data, Angular services, and a streamlined interface for both administrators & users.
